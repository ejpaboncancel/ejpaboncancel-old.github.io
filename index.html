<h1>Research</h1>
<h4> <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/summerug/2022/#summerparticipants">(Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics)</a> </h4>
<p> June - August 2022
<br> Summer research experience in Combinatorics funded by the National Science Foundation. Currently working in the study of permutation-invariant parking
  sequences, specifically with the goal to characterize these combinatorial objects by developing sufficient and necessary conditions. </br> </p>
