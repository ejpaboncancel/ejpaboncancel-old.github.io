<h1>Current research</h1>
<h4><a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/summerug/2022/#summerparticipants">(Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics)</a> </h4>
<p><b>June - August 2022</b>
<br><div style="text-align: left"> Summer research experience in Combinatorics at the Institute
  for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, Brown University, funded by the 
  National Science Foundation. Currently working in the study of permutation-invariant parking
  sequences, specifically with the goal to characterize these combinatorial objects by developing 
  sufficient and necessary conditions. </br></div></p>
