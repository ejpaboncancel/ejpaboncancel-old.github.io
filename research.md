<p> I am mostly interested in working in Number Theory, mainly the study of prime numbers and the properties that may arise. I want
to investigate how properties of prime numbers can be applied to cryptography and related areas of cybersecurity. I have also
participated in projects related to Abstract Algebra, in the area of Algebraic Coding Theory/Information Theory. From June 2022 to August 2022, I participated in the Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics REU in which I studied Algebraic Combinatorics, specifically the study of parking functions and parking sequences. The following is a list of the projects in which I have participated, from the first project to the most recent: </p>
