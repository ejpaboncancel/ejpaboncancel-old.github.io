<p> I am mostly interested in working in Number Theory, mainly the study of prime numbers and the properties that may arise. I have also
participated projects related to Abstract Algebra, in the area of Algebraic Coding Theory. Currently, I am working with Combinatorics,
speciffically the study of parking functions and parking sequences, and the characterization of necessary and sufficient conditions for
a sequence to be a parking sequence. The following is a list of the projecs in which I have participated in: </p>

1. Improving Hermitian-Lifted Codes with their Automorphism Group
2. Improving the Minimum Distance Bound of Trace Goppa Codes
3. The Study of \[ \tau_n \]-primes
4. The Study of \[ \tau_n \]-atoms
5. Characterizing Parking Sequences
