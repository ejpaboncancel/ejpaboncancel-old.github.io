<p> I am mostly interested in working in Number Theory, mainly the study of prime numbers and the properties that may arise. I have also
participated projects related to Abstract Algebra, in the area of Algebraic Coding Theory. Currently, I am working with Combinatorics,
speciffically the study of parking functions and parking sequences, and the characterization of necessary and sufficient conditions for
a sequence to be a parking sequence. The following is a list of the projecs in which I have participated in, from the first project to 
the most recent: </p>

1. The Study of t(n)-atoms <br> (<i>E.J. Pabón-Cancel, R.M. Ortiz-Albino</i>)
2. The Study of t(n)-primes <br> (<i>E.J. Pabón-Cancel, R.M. Ortiz-Albino</i>)
3. Improving the Minimum Distance Bound of Trace Goppa Codes <br> (<i>I. Byrne, N. Dodson, R. Lynch, E.J. Pabón-Cancel, F.L. Piñero-González</i>) 
4. Improving Hermitian-Lifted Codes with their Automorphism Group <br> (<i>E.J. Pabón-Cancel, L. Polanco, F.L. Piñero-González</i>)
5. Characterizing Parking Sequences <br> (<i>D. Chen, E.J. Pabón-Cancel, G. Sargent, P.E. Harris</i>)
